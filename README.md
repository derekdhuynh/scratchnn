# scratchnn

### Purpose
scratchnn is a DL framework that tries to simplify things as much as possible.

It has full, clean implementations of:

* Autodiff (backprop)
* Tensors (probably) 
* High-level Neural Net API including:
    * MLPs
    * CNNs
* Maybe some traditional ML algorithms

I found that using Tensorflow and Keras wasn't enough to get the concepts of DL
into my thick skull, so I decided to try and make a DL framework myself. The
main goals are to educate myself and also provide a useful resource for
other people in who share my position. I encourage you to follow along in the
```
./notebooks
```
directory for explanations, extra resources and to implement everything
here yourself!

### Questions You'll Probably Ask
1. Why don't I just use Tensorflow/Pytorch/JAX/whatever?

        Yes.
