# Neural Networks From Top to Bottom

## Purpose
To understand neural nets from an intuitive and more rigourous approach.
End-to-end examples of creating neural nets from varying levels of abstraction.
* tf.keras (high level)
* Pure TF (using graphs)
* Numpy only (low level, implement backprop etc.)

Examples will be fully-connected and convolutional neural networks.
